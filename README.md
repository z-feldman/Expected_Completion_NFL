# Expected_Completion_NFL
Modeling expected completion in the NFL using Generalized Additive Models and XGBoost with publicly available data.
Submission in 2020 Ohio State Sports and Society Undergraduate Research Fair.



TODO:
Comment code a little more.

Upload data as CSVs (currently only in RDS).

Install nflfastR, get data back to whenever it has (2000 maybe?), train model(s) for all of it.

Check on Mac vs. Windows XGBoost training - not same results between OS. 
See if saving the model and loading it in other OS works, rather than training from scratch.


Want TODOs: 
Add in weather data. Temperature, wind (speed and direction), humidity, precipitation 
(live would be awesome, start of game may still be good also).
